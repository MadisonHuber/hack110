    <h2>COMP110 Final Project</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Title</h4>
    <p style="color:black">COMP110 Review</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Description of Project</h4>
    <p style="color:black">This project is a review of COMP110. It contains multiple pages reviewing the concepts covered in COMP110 with explanations, descriptions, examples, and additional resources related to each specific topic. It also contains a page that lets you search through an array of people objects based on different criteria.</p>

    <h4>110 Programming Concepts Used</h4>
    <p style="color:black">This project mainly used html, but the search page required use of if/else-if logic, events, using HTMLElements in Typescript, arrays, and for loops. Additionally, each page focused on different COMP110 topics, so making those examples touched on some COMP110 topics as well.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Challenges Overcome / New Concepts Learned</h4>
    <p style="color:black">I got more familiar with using html, css, and bootstrap. For example, I learned how to create a navigation bar using bootstrap. At first, I had some challenges getting changes from the Typescript files to affect the corresponding html files, but I eventually got a better grasp of using HTMLElements in Typescript.</p>

    <h4>Goals Achieved</h4>
    <p style="color:black">My main goal was to become more familiar with how to use html, css, and bootstrap. I also got a better idea for how to make things in html that also use work from Typescript files.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Goals Outstanding / Future Work</h4>
    <p style="color:black">Outstanding goals include improving formatting and spacing, finding ways to make the existing code more efficient / find other ways to do the same things, improving accuracy / options for searching, and using more features, such as forms, buttons, breadcrumbs, and alerts.</p>
