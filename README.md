# hack110
<p>
This project is a reference for beginners learning to program in Typescript. It covers fundamental topics including variables, functions, value and reference types, loops, and recursion. It also contains a directory of the Fall 2017 COMP110 teaching staff. Users can search and filter this directory based on several criteria.
</p>
<p>
  In this project, I used HTML, CSS, Typescript, and Bootstrap to build individual pages for each topic. Each page includes an overview of the concept, details about its use, and examples. Additionally, I used Typescript and HTML to implement a directory of people that users can search through using filters such as name or major.
  </p>
  <p>
  Future changse to this project may include more topics or new examples for existing concepts. Additionally, I'd add increased functionality to the search capabilities, allowing users to search through the content pages as well as the directory.
